Shan's First SEI Project > Tic Tac Toe Game

The goal of this project was to display full useage of some of the various languages we have learned in the past few weeks.

I have created a gameboard using Bootstrap, HTML and SASS, and made API calls to the Heroku server using both curl scripts and Ajax. The board itself plays with the use of Jquery, and the page is a single page application.  Throughout the process, Git and GitHub were used for version control.
